OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 

project Perform penetration testing on a web application to identify and exploit security
vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure
authentication mechanisms.

Identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in a web application to enhance its security posture.

SQL Injection:
Goal: Test if the web application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
Method: Attempt to insert malicious SQL queries through input fields to manipulate or retrieve unauthorized data from the database.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Goal: Determine if the application allows the injection of malicious scripts.
Method: Inject scripts into web pages to see if they execute in other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking or data theft.
Insecure Authentication Mechanisms:
Goal: Evaluate the robustness of the application's authentication processes.
Method: Test for weaknesses such as weak passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication, and vulnerabilities in session management to ensure that unauthorized access cannot be easily gained.![Screenshot 2024-08-01 170155](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b464850d-8edb-4e64-bf5b-0671582deebb)
